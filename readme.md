# Gaia JS Discord bot

## Installation / Usage

A bot I wrote for the Gaia Discord server. Take note that the variables, settings, ID's and filepaths are customized to fit my server and the Gaia Discord server so you'll need to change those values yourself. Features are listed below. If there's anything you need help with, join the Discord specified at the bottom and ask me.

### Features; ###
- [x] Levelup-system that is based on chat activity(with a cooldown). It autogrants users different Discord roles when hitting certain levels. See line 58. These stats are stored in a separate file, *stats.json*.
- [x] Logs deleted messages and send them as a botembed to a channelof your choosing. Ignores other bots and webhooks. See line 100.
- [x] A simple filter/swearword listthat deletes certain words and notifies the user that those words are not allowed. WIP. See line 142.
- [x] Cooldown between using commands. See line 167 & 117.
- [x] Basic commands like kick, admin ping, uptime, ban, allowing users to add/remove a role(line 237), say, help, joblisting, faq, todo, voting, guildinfos, purging and a welcome message.
